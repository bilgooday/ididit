---------------------- **BASIC CONCEPT OF OUR APP** ----------------------------

  - create a task of something you need to get done
  - set a date for that task
  - submit it and forget it!
  - Once you set your task you will not be able to adjust the due date and you will get text reminders to perform your task until it is accomplished.
  - The only way to stop the text messages is to assign a buddy to your account and they can send you a unique code which will allow you to cross off that task!
